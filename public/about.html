          <h3>Collin Smith</h3>
          <p>Collin grew up in Eastern Washington working on the family orchard while in school before going to Wenatchee Valley College, Washington State University and Central Washington University wasting 6 years of his life getting degrees. He eventually joined the Army, made selection for 2/75th Ranger Battalion, was stationed in Fort Lewis, and deployed 4 times. After separating from the Army he has started a real estate business and a marijuana producer/processor. All of that worked out so well he has decided to retire and is now at Codefellows learning how to code.<a href="https://github.com/Attonasi"> Collin's Github page</a></p>
