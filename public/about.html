          <h3>Collin Smith</h3>
          <p>Collin grew up in Eastern Washington working on the family orchard while in school before going to Wenatchee Valley College, Washington State University and Central Washington University wasting 6 years of his life getting degrees. He eventually joined the Army, made selection for 2/75th Ranger Battalion, was stationed in Fort Lewis, and deployed 4 times. After separating from the Army he has started a real estate business and a marijuana producer/processor. All of that worked out so well he has decided to retire and is now at Codefellows learning how to code.<a href="https://github.com/Attonasi"> Collin's Github page</a></p>

        <h2>Shiv</h2>
        <img src="data/shiv.jpg">
        <p>Shiv has aspirations of being an inspiration to the next wave of future thinkers. With a background in analytics coupled with a curiousity that never allows him to shut the hell up, the only missing component is legitimate technical skills that will allow inevitable world domination. Or at least a modicum of credibility. Onwards down this beautiful path of constant frustration, partial self-hatred, and magnificent growth and character development towards liberation we continue.</p>
